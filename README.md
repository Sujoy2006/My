The portfolio includes several animation types that can be applied to any element:

To apply an animation to an element, add the corresponding class and adjust animation delay if needed:

.your-element {
    animation-delay: 0.3s; /* Optional delay */
}
```

You can customize the dark mode colors by modifying the CSS variables in the `[data-theme="dark"]` selector in styles.css.
